Have made this same play quite a few times in the last 2 months.\n   * COVID proof\n   * A solid company run by a solid CEO with good growth and financials\n   * Slack was purchased for $28b but the market has wiped 26% of its market cap off, which is more than $50b so at the very least the overreaction is extended by at least $22b (a 10% increase in market cap from current levels)\n   * Short-term PT of $230 but have no doubt this can break above $275 in 2021. A 24% upside.\n* 24 shares of $FB at $273 with a price target of $280. Have also done this multiple times during the last few months.\n   * COVID proof\n   * Earnings coming up near the end of January.\n   * Zuck might be a lizard, but those IG \"influencers\" you follow from your fake account so your girlfriend doesn't find out will only keep luring you back in.\n   * Political risks surrounding breakup are exaggerated and seem to be an optic play to gain public confidence. Even if this is not the case, the first hearing is years away.\n   * Has the potential to breach $325 during 2021. An upside of 20%.\n* 4 shares of $AMZN at $3250 with a price target of $3350 at least. Have made a bit over $5k only trading swings between $3000 and $3350.\n   * COVID proof\n   * Earnings coming up near the end of January.\n   * Possible to reach ATH which is around $3500 near earnings.\n   * Possible to breach $4000 during the year providing an upside of 23%.\n* 275 shares of $PFE at average $38.62 with a price target of $41-42, not sure how this will go. Have made this play once before when I cashed out at $42.75 just a few weeks ago.\n   * Only speculative play in my portfolio\n   * Not a hold in the long run as this stock is as limp as they come but a reasonable dividend yield. So, not really worried about losing money.\n\nPretty boring shit, no $GME or $PLTR here but looking forward to seeing what other tickers the community is holding on to."

Of course, like the other degenerates on this website, i recognized the potential of $GME and started to buy shares of those. I have 80@23 shares.

That means by a bu-in on 23, i'll get 7 per share.  Since i'm a retard, i want to invest more in it and maximize my winnings as much as possible. So i started looking into options. The most popular app here is Robinhood apparently, but it isn't avaiable outside of the USA. So what are the best brokers for call options in switzerland?\n\nRockets for trust:  \n \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \u200d\ud83d\ude80 \n\nTL;DR Looking to maximize $GME winnings with options, what are the best brokers in switzerland?"

   "Selftext": "$GME my short case for long $gme\n1. Huge EV+ risk that is largely uncorrelated to market risk (short squeeze).  Even low probability of outcome makes more effort and capital worth it.  Piling on the trade actually increases its likelihood.\n2. Fundamentals and activist investor (Cohen) give, at minimum, a plausible semi-bluff on turnaround.  May make errors but error will not be Blockbuster one.\n3. Chart technicals are incredible.  5x move but still largely invisible except to /wsb.  1.35B market cap gives face validity to 10x return even with move that already happened.   \n4. Perception of silliness and dismissal around threat have made short sellers prone to errors and more likely to pay off big.\n\nFor poker folks, it reminds me of holding a big flush draw.    It may not come through, but the possibility allows us to bet aggressively and potentially take the pot even without the hand.  If it hits, we can potentially entice our opponent to pay off big later.   Plus our opponent doesn't take us seriously, increasing their chance of overvaluing their ability to bluff us out."
