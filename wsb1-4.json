This is only the beginning and there's still time for you to secure your first 10 bagger of 2021. \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Why TLRY?**\n\nIt's all in the fundamentals. TLRY got the better end, at least in the short term, of the merger deal with APHA. The premium APHA will pay per share in this reverse acquisition will be of great benefit to TLRY's balance sheet. Tilray's massive potential has now been coupled with strong fundamentals. When (Yes, WHEN not if) weed is legalized in the US, Tilray, a company registered in the US, has the foothold in the US that, when combined with APHA's resources and distribution, will be a DOMINANT force in the market. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nNot only is Tilray in a good position to take over the US Cannabis market, but it also has a strong presence in Canada, where it is headquartered. The merger with APHA means TLRY will own 17.3% of the Canadian Cannabis market, **by far the largest** market share of any other Canadian Cannabis companies. \n\n**The US is a HUGE market to be tapped into\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nGeorgia Senate elections are **TOMORROW,** as of the writing of this post **BOTH** Democratic candidates are the betting favorites to win. **When this happens, the blue wave is complete and weed is all but legalized in the US.** A Democrat-controlled Senate was the last domino needed to fall. It is reasonable to believe that weed can and will be legalized in the US before the end of Q1 2021. \n\nOnce weed is federally legalized, the market expands **EXPONETIALLY** in the US. Weed will become legal in large states such as New York. **Billions of dollars are just sitting that TLRY is in the best position to take** \n\n**TLRY is MASSIVELY undervalued\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nAs of 12/31, TLRY is trading at a very attractive 4.23 \\* book value. MorningStar gives TLRY a fair value of 14$ (As of 1/1/21). Only 1 of 18 analysts have given TLRY a sell rating.\n\n**Wall Street is bullish on TLRY\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nSince it has cooled down since the Biden rally, Tilray has consistently been reaching higher highs and higher lows. It is up around 6% at the time I'm writing this post. Put/Call Ratio is .1! Safe to say Wall Street is preparing for the Blue Wave and the legalization of weed, of which TLRY is in the best position to take advantage of the untapped US market. \n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.livemint.com/news/world/tilray-and-aphria-announce-merger-to-create-the-largest-global-cannabis-company-11608361067376.html](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/tilray-and-aphria-announce-merger-to-create-the-largest-global-cannabis-company-11608361067376.html)\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/22/the-2-best-cannabis-stocks-to-own-in-2021/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/22/the-2-best-cannabis-stocks-to-own-in-2021/)\n\n[https://bookies.com/news/senate-races-odds-tracker](https://bookies.com/news/senate-races-odds-tracker)\n\n[https://mjbizdaily.com/which-states-are-likely-to-legalize-recreational-marijuana-in-2021/](https://mjbizdaily.com/which-states-are-likely-to-legalize-recreational-marijuana-in-2021/)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TLRY/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TLRY/key-statistics/)"
