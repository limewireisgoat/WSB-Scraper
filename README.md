## Implementations

This project is implemented in two different ways, depending on the underlying data structure. In the _heap_ directory, a max heap is used to keep track of the symbols and their associated scores. In the _queue_ directory, a priority queue of max length 3 is used to keep track of the highest scoring symbols.
