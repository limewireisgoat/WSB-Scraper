   "Selftext": "Ok assholes and fucksticks, sit down and listen about the story of a stock called $SRPT, a stock that lost half its stock price after a single phase 2 study report.\n\nLet me start off by giving a bit of background on the study that just gave us the sexiest dip of 2021 so far. Currently Sarepta Therapeutics is engaged in several different drug and disease group projects, with it's main other competitor being Daddy Pfizer. Pfizer is currently competing against Sarepta to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Both companies are developing several drugs to combat this disease which most affects boys around the age 3 and continues to quickly decrease their muscle tone until they are in their teens and presented with a complete loss of ambulation, which eventually leads to heart and lung problems and eventually most of those diagnosed die within their 20's to early 30's. Currently Sarepta is working in 3 main areas of pharmacology Gene Editing, Gene Therapy, and RNA Tech. This study concerned Gene Therapy, where a healthy genetic code is inserted into the body and starts producing whatever the subject's previously flawed genetic code wasn't able to produce. For Duchenne's it is protein fibers that compose muscle. The thing about gene therapy is its a single time medication, a one and done. Once these kids have a dose their DNA contains the appropriate genetics and can produce the proteins. No long term therapies, no daily medications, just injection and improvement.\n\nAll parts of this paragraph are referring to the genetic therapy treatment called SRP-9001. So in Phase 1 of this study (Trial 101) they found that the kids had a high rate of success of protein synthesis after injection, and it was maintained years after injection, a huge success, but that is a highly controlled study without a placebo group, and among a small group of kids. The study that just dropped last week was Trial 102. Trial 102 was Phase 2, and looking for long term sustainability and safety with a larger group of kids, the study did not find enough evidence to prove the therapy was more effective than a placebo, however it was rated as safe, something which Pfizer has had difficulty with in their treatment (more on that later, fuck you I'm writing a lot, and you're gonna read it. Bitch.) The next study, Trial 103, which began Fall of 2020 and will be releasing results primary results May 31st 2021. It is a phase 1 trial, which means it has stronger controls and is more likely to show a positive result, a result which will spike stock prices. Trial 103 will be looking to establish efficacy and safety of this SRP-9001, something which Trial 101 already established, but was contradicted by Trial 102. It is extremely likely Trial 103 will be successful in May. They will also be working on dosage and beginning to create their commercial model for production with these tests. They already are recruiting for Trials 301 and 303 following the completion of Trial 103.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, one failed test hasn't slowed down their pipeline of development at all. This is new technology and they are working to perfect it. It can still be modified and it will be modified. But what if something goes wrong with SRP-9001 or Pfizer completely captures the market? Currently Sarepta has 43 different drug development programs going on 27 of which involve Gene Therapy. In addition they have 2 treatments currently being produced commercially, and another 8 therapies in their final phase of study and waiting for rollout. Finally they have 14 more treatments that are in the preclinical planning phase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSarepta isn't just a purely speculative company, they have therapies in every part of their pipeline, therapies that are life changing and will make the stock explode with any positive news. News which is more than likely coming with the amount of trials they are running and the vast range of therapies they are developing. One test dropped this stock 50%, a negative test result that didn't have to do with dangers of the drug, but difficulty presenting increase in protein synthesis vs the placebo group, something that will quickly be rectified and has only been a speed bump in the development cycle. 50% stock price drop when there are 7 other therapies in the final phases of study and are looking to release research in the coming months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to discuss the competition quickly. Pfizer also has a gene therapy program, and it is in phase 3 of study, whereas Sarepta was in phase 2. However Sarepta was seen as being ahead in development as they began their placebo trial a whole year before Pfizer, Pfizer's placebo trial started just before the new year. Pfizer has now caught up in the race, but they have had several severe side effects in their therapy and are a whole year behind in their placebo, which could show more side effects and might not show strong results against the placebo, in the same way Sarepta had difficulty. Sarepta is well positioned against Pfizer, and at this stock price you are well positioned to take advantage of their hard work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you've gotten this far I'm guessing you'll want some positions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJan 22nd 105$ Call, This is purely based on them rebounding from that unnecessary 50% drop\n\nMay 21 135$ Call, Pre Trial buildup Price\n\nJune 18 185$ Call, Post Trial success Price\n\nJan 21 2022 210$ Call, EOY\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuy them stonks bb, wishing you all the best and strongest diamond hands whatever you buy, as long as it's not puts. And wish these kids some big balls for dealing with a disease that is fucking brutal and unyielding. Thanks for reading so far and  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80"

TSLA  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\nOkay, I need you guys to listen, and listen good because I am going to go over a lot of already known public information about TSLA that somehow the gummy bears here keep forgetting, or just are not accounting for.\n\nTSLA is more than a car business, it's more than a solar power company, and it's more than a tech company.  TSLA has the absolute best long term solution for solar power roofing on the market right now when factoring in maintenance costs, power bill savings, and all installation.  Clean energy over the next few years is going to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 in general because of the movements the USA will make in order to promote clean energy as a country, and the world as a whole will follow.  This means that there will be lots of new properties being built with solar panels, and there will be lots of people who are doing roof repairs swapping to solar panels.  TSLA already has factories in multiple countries, and has the infrastructure to quickly scale up to meet demand, which we have seen back with their model 3 production ramp up, and now with their massive funding, they should be able to do so much more effectively this time than the last.  TSLA will make a lot of money this year, next year, and onward off of their solar panels alone, and they will likely sell very well with the 25 year TSLA warranty in conseration.\n\nSolar market recap/summary:\n\nTSLA has the best solution, competitive pricing for premium roofing, and long term performance because of the 25 year warranty.\n\nTSLA has factories in most of the world already, and is able to scale up really fast in order to meet rapid demand as the demonstrated with the model 3.\n\nNow, that's just the beginning, FSD will have a massive impact when they achieve it because they will no longer be taking market share just from the car industry, but also from uber/lyft/grubhub, etc.  Elon has said before that they want to eventually have enough cars in production to roll out FSD taxi's.  They said initially, they will leave the steering wheel for user override, with the intention of eventually having enough of the roads being self driving cars, and the software being mature enough to remove the steering wheel (we'll see about it, I'm not one to go against papa Elon, but I don't know if people would be okay with that in the next 5 years +).  Elon also said in the same conference, that he wants to allow existing Tesla owners to be able to lend their cars back to Tesla to let them be a part of the FSD taxi service with all profits going to the owner of the car instead of Tesla, which will give them a faster ramp up time in every area because Teslas are popular enough, and the need for extra income is always there, like you retards know.  \n\nSo, to summarize all of this, Tesla isn't a car company, or a solar company, or whatever kind you can think of because Tesla is really just something we haven't seen before, and it will continue to grow, and amaze us in how much of the world they will be able to profit off of.\n\nThis is also why we don't need to worry so much about Tesla competitors in this sense because they are so far ahead of the curve that they aren't playing in a fair fight.  Tesla is done with cars, papa Elon wants to get to a point where nobody owns a car, and everyone uses the Tesla-Express.  This will cripple the insurance business for individual car insurance, since only people who own cars will need it.\n\nThis post is getting long, and so I won't get into all the other upsides of their batteries, and charging stations, but I will say that the upside is just as massive.\n\nGranted, at a certain point papa Elon said this robo-taxi would be ready in 2020+, I would expect it to be ready numbers wise 2022-2023, and infrastructure, and regulation hurdles in production 2024-2025.  I am not saying that TSLA will be uphill constantly on this trip, and that there is not a bubble, but what I am saying is that all of those things accounted for, the entire upside of the company, in terms of it's impact to the world, and how much the world will eventually rely on it, the price is far under where it will be, and this will be competing in the same scale as Amazon within no time (relatively speaking).\n\nTLDR:\n\nTSLA has massive unaccounted for potential on their robo-taxi, and solar roofing future, and even if we are in a bubble, TSLA will eventually be a name everyone knows by name because they own, or use one of their products.
