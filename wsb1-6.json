Around then, $PLTR was booming, and I made $30 off of your brilliance. Then I made a mistake. The greatest mistake of my life thus far. I believed in meme stocks, and started investing in every meme stock there has been since, and made $10 here and there, slowly expanding my portfolio. Then a DD on Black Berry, which is now a cyber security company, working in the public and private sectors, including working with car company\u2019s computer technology, caught my eye, and something about it made me put 80% of my money into it\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.

And I don't really regret any of this. It has been on a steady climb for a couple of days now. Last week the shorts pushed it down, probably trying to shake off more people and spread fear so they could buy in at a lower point. (worked vs. me, i got scared of the idiot crayon TA analysts that said it could go to 15, so i didnt buy the dip and waited for confirmation of runup.)\n\nBut last earnings it was the same, it wasn't too late by any means to get in right before earnings. \n\nFrom Sep. 21 to Sep. 30, the price went from \\~$12.2 to \\~$14.5, or a nearly 20% increase. Then it popped to \\~$20.5 after earnings, or another \\~30%. 2 weeks later it was at \\~$25, or another 25%.\n\nSo, despite it running up 17% before earnings now, last time it gained another +50% on top of that after earnings. And, as the DD shows, this earnings should be even better. The thing is, shorts and investors seem to know this. The float and volume on this is way too high for retail to move it like this, it's not a meme stock anyway. So you still have today to get into this if you believe in the earnings.\n\nOn top of that, the CEO Mark tritton is no imbecile. They have literally hundrets of millions ($325m) to spend on share buybacks until the end of february. **What better point to create shareholder value than to present excellent earnings AND use a ton of the sharebuyback money to blow up the price at the same time?** This duality ensures that shorts start to sweat and the price goes up even more, and for good reason.\n\nCompare this to JWN. They TRIPLED their share price in november due to better than expected earnings, and investors being optimistic about them surviving the pandemic.\n\nThe reason for 70% shorts for BBBY is that everyone expected them to not survive corona, or atleast heavily succumb under their garbage assets and dept. All of that has been taken care of. If BBBY shows again that they are on a sustainable road to profits again, this will fly. On this note, I won't sell for a couple weeks even if earnings do pop it 20%+, will wait for 50% at the least depending on earnings. Could be well another JWN in the makings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRisks: Earnings miss. This is all, but based on the price movement, DD done and history, this should not happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tl;dr:** Share buybacks combined with good earnings and super high short% of float = payday for anyone who still gets in. Compare to previous earnings (these should be even better) and the pop of another retailer in november, JWN."

Centralizing operations will lead to massive economy of scale improvement. \n2) Allows them to move from OTC markets to the NYSE/NASDAQ.\n3) Allows them to use banks.
