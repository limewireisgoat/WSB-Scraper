That will open an iMessage window.\n\nOnce there, type in \"Fund account\". It will ask you to click a link to login to TDA on Safari then you can come back to the iMessage and it will ask you to click on a 'Deposit Menu'. \n\nClick on the 'Deposit Menu' and select the first option which is Apple Pay (Debit Card Deposit) and from there you're good to go! Just keep following the instructions.\n\nTL;DR: TD Ameritrade also offers Instant Deposit for iOS but if you're on Android...R.I.P. I guess.

But since GOOG doesn\u2019t pay dividends, the only way to make money is by selling it to other investor at a higher price. But that investor is buying that stock from the first to also make money, by selling it to others at a higher price. And if everyone is buying GOOG stock to sell it to someone else at a higher price, then what real value GOOG stocks have?\n\nIf you come to Alphabet Inc, and show them your 1700$ stock and told them to repay it, they will pay you 0.001$ US Dollars.\n\nSo the only way you can make money, is by taking money generated by new investors.\n\nDefinition of a Ponzi Scheme: \u201cA Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam which generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors.

This post will have two main parts: how we can get Schnatter his job back and also how we can easily make money on PZZA. We'll do the money stuff first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chart**\n\nAs of writing this, PZZA is currently trading at $94.10 and the ATH is $102.25. It is basically guaranteed that it will go back to the ATH. It has also sailed past the 20 and 10 day moving average, so there is no resistance until ATH. This is great for options.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s6klbqs2u4a61.png?width=920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a797b3678678bd167818ee455dcde4d49f6e4512\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition, I suspect that PZZA could be forming a cup and handle pattern. If this plays out, the price target would be (ATH + (ATH - Bottom of Cup)), which is about $131.38. However, we won't know if this is a cup and handle until it happens.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/umhvpr1ou4a61.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b468ffd791469758f0679d390c4b6d72cad01a35\n\nEven if the pattern fails, a delivery pizza restaurant is a pretty safe place for your money to be during the pandemic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other Numbers**\n\n[Target price](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PZZA/research-ratings) of $104.50 with a high of $116.00. I think this is low going off the chart.\n\n[31 million shares](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) float. I know that's a lot, but Schnatter already owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile).\n\nGuys, it's take out pizza in a pandemic it should really be self explanatory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we can talk about how Schnatter can become reinvolved with the company, which should help PZZA stock even more. As you will see, ever since he left the company has not been in as good of a position.\n\n**Why Schnatter Left**\n\nIn 2017, he made a controversial comment about how the [NFL player protests were hurting Papa John's sales](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/22/572779230/papa-johns-ceo-steps-down-following-controversial-remarks-on-nfl) because they were the official pizza sponsor of the NFL. I don't want this to get political, but this is essential to talk about. Schnatter stepped down as CEO but remained on the board of directors. Fast forward into 2018, where Schnatter was reported to have [used a racial slur](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2018/07/11/papa-johns-founder-john-schnatter-allegedly-used-n-word-on-conference-call/?sh=376e4e6e4cfc) in a meeting and it was recorded. Then, he stepped down from his position and no longer had a role in the company (besides for shareholder).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Schnatter's Fight for Innocence**\n\nEver since both of these allegations have surfaced, Schnatter has maintained his innocence and that his words were taken out of context. In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA) Schnatter had with the H3 Podcast (I know many people don't care for them, myself included, but those opinions don't change what Schnatter says in the interview) where he explained why both allegations were false. Regarding the NFL drama, Schnatter claims that he was talking about how the NFL had a leadership problem because they were not addressing the issue. [His exact words were,](https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/ex-fbi-director-clears-papa-johns-founder-of-racial-bias-slams-clearly-inaccurate-media) \"*The NFL is hurting, and more importantly by not resolving the current debacle to the player and owner\u2019s satisfaction, NFL leadership has hurt Papa John\u2019s shareholders.\"* In regards to the allegations of him using a racial slur, former FBI director Louis Freeh, wrote a [report](https://papajohnschnatter.report/read-the-report) where he explains how that in the phone call where he used a slur, he many times stated how he does not support any form of racism, and when he said the word, he was referring to how Colonel Sanders used it and it bothered him. There are two parts to the recording that Schnatter has been fighting in court to get released. The first part includes him using the slur and the context, and the second part includes the other people on the call celebrating after Schnatter hung up talking about how \"they got him\" and they needed to get it to the press right away. This is all according to the H3 interview. It is common sense that Schnatter would not want a recording made public that would damage him, and the company seems intent on keeping it secret, showing that they are likely hiding something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sales are Slumping**\n\n[Sales are decreasing](https://www.statista.com/statistics/221441/papa-johns-total-revenue/#:~:text=Revenue%20of%20Papa%20John's%20worldwide%202007%2D2019&amp;text=American%20pizza%20restaurant%20franchise%20Papa,seeing%20a%20decline%20in%20revenue) every year since his role as been minimized. It's as simple as that. They are in no way a failing company, they are just making less money than they were.\n\n*Processing img 934fvr5jq4a61...*\n\nIn addition to slumping sales, in the [H3 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA), Schnatter claims that Papa John's total number of customers is down significantly and that the quality has decreased. He says he buys about 600 pizzas every 90 days from stores around the country to check on the quality. In my personal experience, I can say the quality at my local Papa John's has decreased over the past couple years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why Schnatter Can Fix This**\n\nSchnatter is more devoted to Papa John's than most CEOs (after Karp and Elon), even though he technically doesn't work for them anymore. As I said before, he does frequent quality checks on the restaurants. The reason he does is is because he cares about the franchise owners and employees who have been negatively impacted by the new management and slumping sales. Who else still puts effort into a company after they've been fired from it? Also, this is just speculation, but since he is still closely associated with the company it is still his reputation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What we can do**\n\nIt's simple, buy shares! If we buy enough shares of PZZA, we (along with Schnatter) can become the majority shareholder of the company. There are [just over 31 million shares float](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) and Schnatter still owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile), or 3.88% of the company. If he can convince a few of the other large investors that it is in their best interest to see him in charge again, we can easily call a shareholder meeting, vote out those who wrongly accused him, and put him, back in charge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Historical Implications**\n\nSchnatter has long been touting \"The Day of Reckoning\" but has not given any hints as to if it has already happened, if it is multiple events, or what it will be specifically. If we can accomplish this, WSB would go down in history (it already has) again for giving a man his company back... and we will make money in the process. We can be the day of reckoning!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Is This Legal?**\n\nYes, it is perfectly legal. This would technically be a hostile takeover, which is legal, but we can just call it something else. Besides, I'm pretty sure Ryan Cohen is trying to do the same thing with Game Stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\nPZZA chart shows easy money, Schnatter is innocent of accusations, only he can bring Papa John's back to its former glory, and we can be the ones to do that.

If you don't know what a SPAC is, it's basically a blank-check company that allows a sponsor/manager to go and merge with a private company and therefore make them public. Once the target is announced, there is a pop in price because people rush into the SPAC (in some cases, rush out if the target seems shitty). \n\nNow, here's how to make the tendies. Chamath Palihapitiya is the king of the SPAC. If you need proof, look at his track record. $IPOA today is $SPCE. $IPOB today is $OPEN. $IPOC is becoming $CLOV. $IPOD is not announced yet, $IPOE was announced yesterday (becoming SoFi), and $IPOF is not announced yet either. Go look at the track record. It's flawless. Every one of the announced SPACs is up over 100%. $IPOD and $IPOF are not even announced yet, and they're up a lot already. \n\nChamath's plan is to create 26 SPACs, $IPOA-$IPOZ. This is the best part. You can just buy into the SPAC and sell on the pop of the announcement, or if you believe in the SPAC, you can hold it. This man creates diamonds from anything he touches. \n\nMake him your dad just like I did. You won't regret it. Go get those free tendies lads."

I will lay each one down consecutively, showing a near-future reality in which a company is set to quintuple if not 10x it's revenue over the next 10 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 25-35% or more of new car sales will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. The average car life is [12 years](https://www.aarp.org/auto/trends-lifestyle/info-2018/how-long-do-cars-last.html#:~:text=A%20typical%20passenger%20car%20should,Lyman%2C%20chief%20analyst%20at%20TrueCar). It is likely that by 2033-2035, a majority of U.S cars are electric. \n2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. [This](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/12/f69/GITT%20ISATT%20EVs%20at%20Scale%20Grid%20Summary%20Report%20FINAL%20Nov2019.pdf) **is a fantastic read--the \"high\" (EV adoption) scenario doesn't show 90% EVs till 2040...which smaller than what is currently happening with new EV models / State/Country bans on ICE vehicles**. The average American home uses \\~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3 (75kWh battery), BARELY drive (no commute) and still charge 6-7 times a month (from 20% to 80%), averaging around 13 kWh per day.  A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive, especially when heating the car. **For a non-commuter thats a 30-40% increase, for a daily commuter that's almost a 100% increase.** By 2025, if \\~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation planning, permitting, and construction takes a long time. They have to front run this big time because generation facilities (wind/solar) take time to plan, permit, build, and hook-in (HVDC). We're already seeing an absolute renaissance in wind and its only going to keep accelerating along with the EV adoption curve. \n   1. (2B) Additionally, there are other factors behind growing grid demand: California is considering banning gas heating in new homes (Electric heating and anti-gas legislation will increase electric demand for thermal units), an increased interest in hydrogen (via electrosis, for aviation / industry)\n   2. (2C) Some people think that added capacity will be curtailed because everyone will charge at night where there is bandwidth for capacity boosts from existing generation facilities. **These people are wrong**. While night-charging will *assuage* total added generation capacity requirements, there isn't enough current night (natural gas) generation capacity to meet the demand of 40-50% EVs, and (see below) its unlikely Natural Gas is gonna keep as fast as it has been, for political reasons. Additionally (1) Not everyone is going to have home charging (apartment buildings, street parking rowhomes) and thus will supercharge at work/while commuting, (2) many people aren't that disciplined to save $3-4 on a charge, (3) people will live their lives normally--charging when they need, often during the day. **A ton of added capacity is needed.** \n3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. As of yesterday, /r/Energy had an [article](https://renewablesnow.com/news/renewables-make-71-of-new-us-power-capacity-in-11-mo-2020-727014/) showing how 71% of the added energy (8000mW wind, 6500mW solar) capacity in 2020 was renewables. This phenomenon has two causes. **(1)** Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind is FAR cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Banks are scared of liberals: Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now (Just this week, Trump opened up those Alaskan areas for bidding and nobody bidded, literally), and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end of oil (and, honestly, nuclear) is near. **(2)** Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion (as noted above). Natural gas isn't that green (big methane problems) and while it's cheap af, its not everywhere (pipeline limits), and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc), which are ALL liberal, are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. Don't believe me? Go read up on California banning natural gas. Yea, Cali can be crazy, but it is almost ALWAYS the harbinger of progressive thinking. Expect that to carry forward. \n4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. Its an amazing kick off to his first year in office. He needs to find a way to boost employment before 2022 in order to have a growth-narrative for the midterms. 2022 midterms don't look good for democrats, and if he doesn't have a strong 2021 year (or at least, optically) he'll get lame ducked in 2023-2024. He's not running in 2024, he's too fucking old. So, how does he go into the twilight of his career with the narrative of a 'Unifier'? He does something everyone can get behind: infrastructure. With the recent Trump supporter capital storming, Biden has some great political bandwidth to hit the ground running. \n5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even with the two blue Georgia seats, there is \\*\\*ZERO\\*\\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause he's ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. No-filibuster 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening. Yet, Biden does need to cater to his liberal supporters and fire up the DNC base in 2022. A great way to get people onboard is to blend an infrastructure bill with elements of the Green New Deal. He has to do this. Its the only way to sneak green policies into implementation to cater to the Left. Standalone 'Green New Deal' isn't happening and McConnell isn't going to let something named that pass, but may let green elements be sluffed into a general infrastructure bill. All this aside, infrastructure is *NEEDED.* Everyone and their mother knows this. It's pushing on an open door, at precisely the right time. \n6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes. Yeah, he'll help EV adoption, but that's pretty limited to subsidies (the $7,500 subsidy expansion for Tesla and GM just failed as a line item) and research subsidies. Not good enough for the Left. \n7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at the maps below for for U.S. solar and Wind geographic advantages. What do you notice? For the most part, there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest, Great Lakes, and NE Offshore region. There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor/Great Lakes offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. **If you want to do a Green Energy bill that also serves as a bipartisan stimulus, there are geographic comparative advantages that give you a compelling reason to create green energy in Red states.** \n\n[Solar Irradiance Map \\(2018\\)](https://preview.redd.it/uilz3fxoc0a61.jpg?width=5101&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25925051c0038ace93d3cd47392b88a231f1af0c)\n\n[Wind Power Map--Note the Great Lakes, Midwest, and NE Corridor Offshore](https://preview.redd.it/dwhto5huc0a61.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f5b15711a5dbf1ee5454007d153d0504dad168a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**However, the Grid currently isn't configured to transport the level of green energy needed to meet the heightened demand environment in 2030-2040. Guess what links huge solar fields and onshore/offshore wind to population centers? HVDC does. The HVDC network to pipe \"local\" (regional) renewable hotspots to population centers doesn't exist. See the below map of the U.S. HVDC Grid, and compare it to Europe and China's:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5cn24w2h0a61.png?width=560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fcd18d57aea8a5ad24b080d9f5dc6e77e48d34a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Note all the Offshore Wind to the North Sea, and the connections between Renewable hot spots \\(Iceland, etc\\) to population centers](https://i.redd.it/hmijqzkxh0a61.gif)\n\n[This won't be surprising. The Chinese do big infrastructure, and half the Party back in the 90s were hydrologic engineers. ](https://preview.redd.it/9ycsi1d5i0a61.jpg?width=1240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fafd25e782fbd27964d1b1f958e80ea46fc855d6)\n\nIn addition to these maps, look at the [**global list of HVDC projects Wikipedia page**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HVDC_projects)**. Observe how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.** It's not our fault, in the past grid owners could easily locate generation facilities near enough to minimize high voltage lines. However, things are changing--wind and solar take space, aren't as location-independent as gas/coal/nuclear. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* (8) **Microgrids won't solve the issue.** Obviously Tesla city-level distributed powerpacks will happen, but this isn't an either-or situation. **The speed of EV adoption and the heightened demand environment are going to vastly outpace the adoption of rooftop solar (what many microgrid proponents suggest can fully-deal with grid demand)**. Grid-level wind/solar is still needed, and those sources need to be connected in, so again, a regionalized HVDC connection system from renewable --&gt; population center is still needed. \n* (9) **The more HVDC connections that are installed, the more compelling it will be to form longer-linkages (more HVDC) between population centers (and therefore, storage).** Connected regional grids (think--Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania connected mutually via Great Lakes Wind farms that are, in turn, connected to the NE Corridor) marginally decrease the amount of total net storage needed in the system, as \"the wind is always blowing/sun is always shining somewhere\". This process will continue until we eventually have a 'Supergrid'--but NOT one by original purpose--which is what people usually argue against when people mention that word, but convenience--alongside thousands of microgrids. \n   * If this seems extreme to you, sit back, consider the 2nd point of this post, then imagine 80% of Cars are EVs within 15 years. A vast majority of Semi-trucks are electric. Advances in batteries mean that Planes, shipping, and tons of military applications now all use huge amounts of power. Grid demand is way, WAY higher than it was when the biggest demand source were light bulbs and your shitty AC unit. \n* (10) **The way to play this is by going to the manufacturer / installer**. **Prysmian Group ($PRYMY, an ADR) is the largest HVDC provider in the world. It's also a pure play.** It is based in Milan, but its a union of 3 companies--one of which is General Cable (American), which produces HVDC domestically. See the below image, which is from Prysmian's 2019 annual report. The green dots are energy cable (HVDC) manufacturing facilities. See a trend? They're almost all in Red states (again--renewables largely in Red States, HVDC manufacturing in Red states...)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m5vyb46so0a61.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=202e61a596fcac6e73c1584e3a5eeec9059dec58\n\n* (11) **45% of Prysmian's revenue is Grid work. It has a P/E of 44. What happens when Prysmian's revenue goes up by 3x over the next 5 years, and 10x by 2030?** There is SO much work to be done modernizing the U.S. grid, but then on to the rest of the world. The realities I am describing--EVs--&gt; heightened demand --&gt; green is cheap --&gt; it needs to be hooked in --&gt; regional grid connections lower net amount of storage needed in aggregate, etc etc etc, aren't unique to the first world. Other countries will follow suit. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nI do not believe this reality is baked into the price. Although everyone knows grid upgrades are coming (hence 44 P/E), I don't think that people are taking these large-phenomenon down to their lower level logical-conclusions. The gradual, inadvertent development of the Supergrid is inevitable, necessary, and politically convenient for a guy so desperate to bridge the political divide. Prysmian is well suited to take full advantage of American infrastructure as well as the rest of the world. \n\n\\------------------\n\nTL/DR:\n\n**EVs adoption curves are getting faster and faster, and are going to drive higher electrical demands from the Grid, which will be met with Green Energy. This will require a huge increase in HVDC installations. This is occurring at exactly the time Biden needs a big infrastructure plan for political-economic reasons, and the realities of Green energy in the U.S. actually benefit Red States pretty bigly. Gradually, HVDC networks will reach a point where a macro-regional 'Supergrids' become a reality (in order to lower aggregate storage requirements and add more safety/redundancy). $PRYMY (Prysmian Group) is the worlds largest HVDC provider and they manufacture HVDC in the U.S. They are primed to benefit from this trend, and it is currently vastly undervalued.** \n\nSorry no rockets. Also, there aren't options available, so you'll have to slow boat this."
