   "Selftext": " Fellow smooth brains, broke boiz, and gainz girls,\n\nI've had a lot of down time this week since I'm cooped up in q-tine with the vid. Figured I'd change it up and spend time to listen and read about people who actually made money in the markets, instead of edging to EOY loss porn for 10 days straight.\n\nI found a few different hedge fund daddies to keep me company during the alt reality of rona isolation. These dudes weren't smooth brain; they read books and wrote them too. They made all their tendies in the pre-dawn era before the internet, but a lot of their concepts are the foundations of today's DD flair.\n\nOne of these hedge fund daddies is Peter Lynch; the silver fox averaged 30% returns over 13 years as manager of Fidelity's Magellan Fund. He frequently &amp; routinely states \"Stonks only go up\" and \"Buy the FKN DIP\" in pre-internet era interviews and he's got a rager for the market advantages of individuals (retail, us, idiots) vs. wall street (chads, citron, warren buffet). He actually walked away from Wall Street at relatively young age to spend more time with his family. This decision can only be interpreted one way; he made enough tendies to send his wife's boyfriend back to instructing $PTON classes and preying on other men's wives. For this, the legacy of he Silver Fox must be immortalized - he is legend.\n\nAnyway, Lynch is pretty famous for coining the characteristics (traits) of a ten bagger. Since I've got lots of time and there's no loss porn on the weekends, I thought it would be an interesting idea to back test some of these ideas on WSB favorites &amp; active bag holders like $RKT, $PLTR, and $TSLA.\n\n**10 Traits of a Ten Bagger:**\n\n**1. Name is Dull or Ridiculous: All tickers check.**\n\n\u00b7 Red $RKT? Sheesh dude calm down.\n\n\u00b7 $PLTR? Fool of a took!\n\n\u00b7 $TSLA? That socialist electrician?\n\n**2. It does something dull: All tickers check.**\n\n\u00b7 $RKT: Mortgage loan processing.\n\n\u00b7 $PLTR: Data aggregation &amp; integration. wut?\n\n\u00b7 $TSLA: Sells cars.\n\n**3. It Does something disagreeable: All tickers check.**\n\n\u00b7 $RKT: Online loan processing is perceived as untrustworthy by institutions &amp; individuals.\n\n\u00b7 $PLTR: Blah blah blah oppression, NSA &amp; data privacy\n\n\u00b7 $TSLA: \"There will never be a market for EVs!\"\n\n**4. Institutions don't own &amp; analysts don't follow: Only $PLTR checks.**\n\n\u00b7 $RKT: 15 analysts have coverage with an avg. PT of $24.7\n\n\u00b7 $PLTR: 7 analysts have coverage with an avg. PT of $15\n\n\u00b7 $TSLA: Everyone talkin' TSLA these days. Irrelevant.\n\n**5. It's depressing: All 3 tickers check with some massaging of the interpretation.**\n\n\u00b7 $RKT: When I grew up, home loan refinancing was a bad thing borne from necessity. Exchanging equity for better loan terms prolongs payments and adds long-term interest. These improve affordability and increase in popularity with each recession.\n\n\u00b7 $PLTR: Literally sells system solutions for crisis situations. Think COVID/Conflict/Fraud.\n\n\u00b7 $TSLA: The narrative sells because the climate crisis is the defining issue of our age.\n\n**6. The industry isn't growing: All 3 check with some massaging of the interpretation.**\n\n\u00b7 $RKT: Growth is not the same as appreciation. The housing market continues to spike in part because of archaic housing &amp; city planning policies that prevent new supply from entering markets.\n\n\u00b7 $PLTR: New data points &amp; software solutions continue to be introduced &amp; sold, but PLTR is unique in it's integration &amp; aggregation capabilities. Nobody else is selling this particular solution; in fact, PLTR views their biggest competition as a companies' desire to internalize this solution.\n\n\u00b7 $TSLA: EVs sales are in fact growing exponentially, however the sales are pulling demand from the existing market share of the automobile industry, not creating new market share. Additionally, modern transportation policy ***likely*** reduces the amount of new cars on the road as EVs are increasingly exposed as an edge case for addressing climate change. Also, ARK (momma Wood) has done a bunch of research re: the pending used-car bubble that will put further ownership equity pressure on loans, dealers, and individuals still buying used ICE cars. The combined pressures of costs associated with personal vehicle ownership, rapid asset depreciation, autonomous ride hailing, modern transpo plans focused on decreased congestion &amp; emissions, will significantly reduce the size of this industry in the near/mid term future.\n\no P.S. I &lt;3 Pete Bootycheeks, US Transpo Sec. Build all the rails &amp; bike lanes.\n\n**7. It's got a NICHE: All 3 check.**\n\n\u00b7 $RKT: mobile loan processing. Speed speed speed. Ease ease ease. Cheese cheese cheese. $RKT's solutions saves time, better prepare buyers &amp; refinancers, simplifies the process, and reduces monthly expense. Rock solid like my $RKT in the mornings.\n\n\u00b7 $PLTR: how many of you work at a fortune 500 (not Wendy\u2019s) that requires you to query data for routine reports? How many logins do you have? how many systems do you need to navigate? Do you know how your co addresses this? They pay managers who can't write =sumif() excel functions, to piece together PowerPoints and workflow diagrams that communicate system enhancements to $100k+ soft devs and system architects who then Frankenstein together 10+ paid SAAS \"solutions\" in 1-3 years. $PLTR comes in hot and ready like the domineos pizza pie delivery guy ready to feed &amp; seed the shmeat lovers. $PLTR works with what you got, growers and showers, to create a highly scalable 2 way data integration &amp; aggregation system in hours.\n\n\u00b7 $TSLA: Battery &amp; self driving tech are the biggest niches at this point, but don't sleep on those EV credits. Wall street industry idiots are salty that $TSLA can improve margins by selling polluter permission slips to allow polluters to pollute, but co's love to pollute so those things print.\n\n**8. Recurring Revenues: All 3 check.**\n\n\u00b7 $RKT: Definition of \"Recurring\": \"occurring again periodically or repeatedly.\" $RKT reports a lot of money each quarter's earnings reports. Don't @ me.\n\n\u00b7 $PLTR: the business model is designed to scale billing in tandem with gains made from solution utility.\n\n\u00b7 $TSLA: At this stage, car sales are growing and we haven't hit an extended downturn in the cyclical environment. Just wait till the FSD, energy credits, insurance, ride hailing, and grid energy revenues print infinitely and indefinitely. Anticipate unrealized earnings &amp; receivables to pace with earnings growth.\n\n**-(9. Insiders are buying: $RKT &amp; $TSLA check.**\n\n\u00b7 $RKT: Daddy Dan Gilbert &amp; Juicy Jay Farner were loading up on shares &lt; $20 in August\n\n\u00b7 $PLTR: Mithril (a Papa Thiel fund) got clearance to buy an s-ton of $PLTR at some point last week. Basically, a buy back, but we'll see more when the lock-up period ends.\n\n\u00b7 $TSLA: Denholym sold 43k shares at \\~$400 per, but Emperor Elon is diamond handing his market cap option tranches which counts IMO.\n\n**-(10. Its buying back shares: $RKT &amp; $PLTR check.**\n\n\u00b7 $RKT: Announced a completed $1B buyback on the last earnings call\n\n\u00b7 $PLTR: Momma Wood (ARK) has been adding $1m+ in shares each week, but it basically just went public so too early for this.\n\n\u00b7 $TSLA: Issuing new funds to improve cash positions at elevated market cap.\n\nPositions:\n\nBuy the dip, LONG $RKT &amp; $PLTR until $75b market cap, then readjust thesis. $TSLA to $1T market cap, then pivot into 2% divvie stocks till' I transcend into a Silver Fox incarnate. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80"

    "$FB"
   ],
   "Selftext": "In this post, we shall explore how the one- and two-stage Gordon Growth Models, and Dividend Discount Model, relate to growth rates, valuations, earnings, dividends, inflation, and return on investment.\n\nLet E = earnings d = dividend P = price r = discount rate g = (terminal) dividend growth rate\n\nThen y = d/P is the dividend yield Y = E/P is the earnings yield P/E = 1/Y p = d/E is dividend payout ratio\n\nAccording to the Gordon Growth Model,\n\ny = d/P = r - g.\n\nHence,\n\nY = y/p.\n\nSo, for example, if r = 10% is the required return, and the growth rate is g = 3%, then dividend yield should be y = 7%.\n\nIf also the payout ratio is 70%, then the P/E must be 10. If the payout ratio is p = 100%, then the P/E can be ~14.\n\nIt may appear counter-intuitive that higher retention requires a lower P/E. But remember that we are talking about dividend growth rates, g, not earnings growth rates.\n\nSo if a firm is able to grow dividends without retaining earnings, this likely means that it benefits from pricing power, protecting from inflation, or that it has conservative accounting.\n\nHowever, when the dividend is zero, g cannot be measured, and the model breaks down.\n\nSo we assume that earnings represent distributable cash, in the sense that if the dividend payout were 100%, the business could sustain constant earnings. And then we consider the situation where a fast-growing company wishes to retain all of its earnings for future growth. However, indefinite growth at a rate higher than the nominal GDP is implausible. And indefinite growth without dividends is, in theory, not worth anything. To be valuable, a company must eventually harvest earnings. Or it must be acquired, and its survivor must harvest earnings. So, consider the situation where a company grows quickly for a period of time and then grows more slowly while paying dividends. For this, we may apply a two-stage Gordon Growth Model, which is really just a special case of the Dividend Discount Model (DDM). For simplicity, assume the initial growth is g, and the payout ratio is zero, for a period of n years, prior to slowing to a (dividend and earnings) terminal growth rate h, and a 100% payout ratio, with dividend d.\n\nThe correct price after n years is given by the Gordon Growth Model:\n\nP_n = d / (r - h).\n\nBut in order for this price to be achieved in n years, the price today must be,\n\nP_n = d_n / [(r - h) (1 + r)n].\n\nAt time n, d_n = E_n, which will have grown:\n\nE_n = E (1 + g)n.\n\nHence,\n\nP = E (1 + g)n / [(r - h) (1 + r)n]\n\n= [(1 + g) / (1 + r)]n * E / (r - h).\n\nRearranging, we find,\n\ng = [(1 + r) * [(r - h) (P/E)]1/n - 1] * 100%\n\nAssume, for example, if the discount rate (required return) is r = 10%, and the initial P/E is 100.\n\nIf the terminal growth rate is h = 0 after n = 10 years, then the required earnings growth spurt for these 10 years will be g = 38.5% per annum, for a 26-fold increase in earnings. But, after all, r = 10% is a nominal discount rate, a mature company may be expected to grow at a rate of\n\nh = i + G,\n\nwhere i = inflation rate and G = real GDP growth rate.\n\nSo if i = 3% and G = 2%, then, h = 5% may be expected at maturity, with a 100% dividend payout policy.\n\nReviewing the formula, then, we find the following results for different periods of growth, n, where g = growth rate, and m = E_n / E, the factor by which earnings multiply:\n\nn = 10 years g = 29.2% m = 13 times\n\nn = 15 years g = 22.5% m = 21 times\n\nn = 20 years g = 19.2% m = 34 times\n\nWe see then, that a business must sustain approximately 20% earnings growth for 20 years in order for it to justify a current P/E of 100, assuming it matures at year 20. A higher hurdle rate, r, would require more aggressive assumptions about growth, and a lower hurdle rate would require less aggressive growth assumptions. Naturally, growth rates of high-growth companies tend to fall continuously, with size (law of large numbers) and competition. But this is a rough illustration of what is required. One may experiment with the formula using other P/E ratios, etc. Also, the formula does not directly apply to loss-making companies. And, in fact, some loss-making companies can become profitable and grow earnings quickly via operating leverage. $FB is one such example. When it IPO'd in 2012, it was barely profitable. However, it subsequently grew earnings one thousandfold, because revenues rose faster than costs.\n\nGrowth rates in the above examples are rare, so forecasting them should be rather difficult."

The rule limits the percentage of an investment in equity securities that can be borrowed with a margin loan. A wake-up call is scheduled...*\n\n*It was widely reported this week that total margin debt reached a new high of $722B. The WSJ\u2019s 12/28 lead Business and Finance story profiled a $TSLA retail investor, a civil engineer, who had parlayed a $23k option investment in $TSLA into a $2m position. Oh boy. The gentleman is to surely and genuinely be commended for the investment. An 87x gain in a short period is extraordinary (I've never done that, nor will I). That said, a quick perusal of $TSLA twitter commentary and recommendations is terrifying.*\n\n*One can read the Journal article,* [*Investors Double Down on Stocks, Pushing Margin Debt to Record TSLA*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-double-down-on-stocks-pushing-margin-debt-to-record-11609077600)*, and draw two conclusions. One, \u201cThis must be extremely dangerous,\u201d or two, \u201cSurely I can get rich quick too.\u201d Human nature being what it is\u2026 For the latter, the civil engineer offers this advice on his Twitter page, \u201cIf you have no Tesla call options, you may want to do the math and consider using LEAPS as a way to accelerate your accumulation of Tesla stock. 40X in 2020. Another 50X by 2025.\u201d Whoa.*\n\n*A series of Q&amp;A tweets ensues (thanks for the heads up* [*@RomanRubinstein*](https://twitter.com/romanrubinstein?lang=en)*) on which broker/dealers offer the most margin, the lowest interest rate on margin debt, and how to borrow the most money and obtain the maximum leverage by purchasing call options. \u201cMaintain margin value of 50% in my portfolio and the margin borrowing rides forever,\u201d goes the advice. Please consider the danger of heeding this advice. The engineer should risk-off and live a happy life.*\n\n*A whole bunch of people are going to lose a whole bunch of money.*\n\n*Reading through a series of tweets among the Tesla (and others) option crowd, you see little, if any, mention of maintenance margin requirements. FINRA requires investors, strike that, speculators, to maintain equity of at least 25% of the value of an account. Leverage kills. Maintenance rates can be set above the minimum threshold. The concept of posting shares in stocks like $TSLA, $TWTR, or any established company trading for 20x or 30x sales &amp; borrowing half of the value and then buying calls on the same shares posted as collateral is insanity. The only \u201cmath\u201d a speculator should be doing is knowing at what price against the shares in the account will new equity be required. Most brokers don\u2019t wait around for a customer to come up with new cash or securities to deposit. What do they do?*\n\n*They sell down your shares to get to equity compliance. More decline? More forced selling. Depending on maintenance margin thresholds, you can lose it all in a hurry. Red flags are abundant, beyond simply the new record high in total margin and credit market debt outstanding. You can see the bubble in the number of single-contract call options outstanding, in the number of new retail accounts being opened with margin and allowed option trading, and even in the tone of surety by speculators regarding prospects for wildly expensive shares like Tesla.*\n\n*I never thought I\u2019d again see the kind of mania like we saw in the late 1990\u2019s, but here we are. Memories of what can and is likely to happen are long gone. Even a number of professional investors have suspended price as a key determinant of value.  A respected and well-known retired professional investor suggested on Twitter recently that I don\u2019t understand \u201c$TSLA growth math or basic investment theory,\u201d that \u201cstocks look forward, not backward\u201d and that \u201cP/E\u2019s are a function of exponential growth rates, not industry.\u201d*\n\n*The last time an investment pro came unglued was January 2000 at a newspaper roundtable. The C.I.O/PM for one of the largest &amp; oldest growth &amp; income funds at the time took exception to the notion that $MSFT shareholders would lose money for the next 15 years, which they did. I\u2019d written 6 pages on the prediction in my 1/1/2000 letter (on the website) and discussed it at the roundtable. My co-panelist became unhinged because he and his firm had 5% of capital in $MSFT, which was then a $620B market cap on $20B in sales, 31x sales &amp; 80x earnings.*\n\n*You can apply the same logic to $TSLA or to any number of dangerously overvalued fashionable disruptive growers today. The Tesla bull proffering margined purchase of $TSLA LEAPS expects a $1,000 share price this year, $5,000 the next and $22,000 by 2025.*\n\n*Now, a $22,000 stock price, assuming no further dilution above today\u2019s 1.1B fully diluted shares outstanding, gets you to a $24 trillion market value, which must be reasonable given that the entire market value of the S&amp;P 500 today is only \\~$31 trillion &amp; global GDP is $88T. When your TAM (the new eyeballs) is 100% global auto market share, robotaxi, energy grid, insurance and economic population of Mars, no price is too high. No argument that Tesla has made great strides in manufacturing efficiency and are now producing a more reliable product.*\n\n*I also believe disruption of the auto industry will require an enormous amount of capital to grow and the established OEM\u2019s won\u2019t play dead. You can't simply separate auto margins and capital requirements from nearly infinite profitability earned by selling software upgrades. Shouldn\u2019t the upgrades be considered part of total vehicle cost? To what extent did the Apples and Microsofts of the world thrive on a regular upgrade cycle, much of which was and is planned. How often are you compelled into a new iPhone or iPad? Prior to the subscription model, at what point did Microsoft not support an older operating system or Office suite? Will EV buyers purchase a new car every 2-3 years? How much of the world can afford a more expensive vehicle than the current global average car price?*\n\n*Regardless of one's beliefs on business quality &amp; growth prospects, paying a too-high price can destroy future investment return. #neversell? When price becomes ridiculous to the most optimistic business case you #bettersell. Price matters and the current environment is nuts. The current folly for price not mattering, or being justifiably high, reminds me of a well known sell-side report on Berkshire Hathaway in 1998 which assumed as undervalued both $BRK\u2019s shares and its stock portfolio against an assumed \u201creasonable\u201d 40x market multiple.*\n\n*Berkshire\u2019s shares, expensive, would fall by half over the next 18 months to a February 2000 low. It\u2019s become fashionable to explain investment process by saying price is the last consideration. Too often lately, price isn\u2019t even a consideration, especially for holy growers. While I did not have a short position on $MSFT in 2000, I do have a very small recent short on Tesla today so take my comments w/ a grain of salt. I did buy $MSFT in '06 after it fell by \\~75% and owned it for a decade, trimming when dear and adding to the position when cheap.*\n\n*Short selling is very risky and those w/ sizable short positions on Tesla at the outset of 2020 would have suffered real damage given the 720% advance during the year. I've read that shorts lost $38B during '20 alone on their collective positions &amp; short interest is way down. I happen to think the valuation is now so large to protect against a continued runaway price, particularly now that* u/elonmusk *secured its entry in the S&amp;P 500 by engineering 4 quarters of profits by cutting R&amp;D, SG&amp;A and thanks to environmental credits courtesy $GM &amp; $FCA.*\n\n*Still, I\u2019d never employ a large short position given unlimited downside and a max return of 100%. Margin is required against short positions. What appears to be a growing army of retail option traders, many employing sizable margin debt, is a recipe for disaster. Price and quality conscious investors get uncomfortable at times like these. I am extremely uncomfortable. I hope those that have no idea what they are doing heed growing and now very high risk and fully understand downside and what margin calls and maintenance margin mean.*\n\n*Many, many speculators will lose much and even all of their money at some point as this bubble breaks. Now is the time to reduce risk. You could feel badly for employees that were paid in non-qualified stock options and kept their shares upon exercise in the late 1990\u2019s. When shares plummeted in the wake of the tech bubble the tax liability due on gain realized as income upon exercise was still due and payable, despite shares that were way below the exercise price. It was bad. Many lost everything but weren\u2019t in a position to understand risk.*\n\n*Borrowing against Tesla (or any) shares and buying call options presents serious deliberately assumed risk. For perspective, a 92% decline takes the shares back to where they started 2020! With margin, it will take way less than a 92% decline to introduce wipeout.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Responding to a PM who claims that the $TSLA price target of $1,200, total EV adoption of 20%, and 5% market share in global auto-manufacturing is reasonable, Bloomstran had this to say:**\n\n*You have EV adoption rising from 3% to 20% in five years, a 6x increase (46% CAGR) and Tesla market share at 25%. 2019 global new vehicle sales totaled \\~95m units and will be way lower this year. Let's call 2020 a throwaway for the industry, and hats off to* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *for growing. From the 2019 base, if we assume 4% market growth then new global units in 2025 would be 115m and at your expected 20% share Tesla would sell 29 million vehicles. Is this your assumption? Sounds aggressive given Tesla\u2019s 500k unit run rate for 2020 and 1/2% market share.*\n\n*Now, US new vehicle prices are $38k but significantly lower worldwide, let\u2019s say $30k per vehicle sold globally. The average Tesla looks to range from high $30k\u2019s for the Model 3 to $55k for the Model 3 Performance to $125k for the Model X Performance fully loaded.  What do you expect for an average selling price for Tesla in 2025? I\u2019d presume that as market share expands ASP\u2019s will have to fall to affordable. I\u2019m trying to get to a revenue number.*\n\n*Perhaps the governments of the world will be giving $2k per person, $8k per family of 4 in annual perpetuity, surely making new cars more affordable! If Tesla sells 29m units in 2025 @ $34.5k per unit, that gets sales to $1 trillion, a CAGR of \\~102% for five years. Reasonable?*\n\n*Moving on, you have a 2025 EPS target of $24/share. On how many shares shall we apply your expected per-share figure? Shares outstanding at 9/30 totaled 948m, up from 905m at yearend 2019. An additional $5B in shares were sold recently to the public in \u201cat-the-market\u201d sales.  The sales were done with no roadshow, risk disclosure or prospectus, unless Goldman\u2019s report upgrading the shares from neutral to buy &amp; a new price target of $780, up from $455, issued days before the announced sale and Goldman\u2019s retention as selling agent, as a \u201cprospectus.\"*\n\n*If the shares were sold at an average of \\~$600/share, the share count would now be 8.3m shares higher, so call the total 956m. You have a price target of $1,200 for the shares, so let\u2019s not forget to include in the count any option and RSU shares issued but not yet exercised.  Recall,* [*@elonmusk*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) *was granted 20m option shares (now 100m thanks to the split) in 2018 by* [*@larryellison*](https://twitter.com/larryellison) *and Elon\u2019s associates on the board. Fully diluted shares total 1.113B right now, and if the stock keeps rising we can assume all options will be exercised and outstanding.*\n\n*So, how many shares should we apply to your $24 EPS target? If we assume zero further dilution (realistic?), then using the 1.113B fully diluted shares including the recent $5b sale, we get to $26.7B in net income. On an even $1 trillion in revenues, that\u2019s a 2.67% profit margin, just a bit higher than the auto industry average of 3% and approaching $MSFT\u2019s 30%.*\n\n*One last missing piece of information, which I haven\u2019t seen mentioned by the Tesla bulls or in your message to me is how much capital will be required to grow sales from 500k units to 29m over the next 5 years?  It looks like over the history of* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *the company has raised $26.5B in equity capital (including the recent $5B) and $16.5B in debt and preferred equity, so a total of $43B. Tesla has a cumulative loss of $5.7B, so it hasn\u2019t produced a positive return on capital.*\n\n*For its last 4 quarters GAAP profits totaled $5.56B, which yields a 2.5% return on capital (equity net of retained losses plus debt minus cash, all adjusted for the recent $5B sale). I fully understand companies can surely lose money or earn little profit as they scale.  With the recent sale of $5B Tesla now has \\~$20B in cash. Is this sufficient to finance its growth over the next 5 years as the company grows units by 102% per year?*\n\n*Since I don\u2019t lean on brevity and given my lack of understanding of basic investment theory, let\u2019s summarize the missing data points necessary to get the stock to your target of $1,200 per share, 50 times your 2025 EPS target of $24 per share. Needed: 1) Tesla unit sales in 2025? 2) Average selling price per unit? 3) Any non-auto related sales \u2013 insurance, robotaxi, insurance, energy sales? 4) Shares outstanding? 5) Total capital: Additional paid in capital, debt, preferred equity, cash?*\n\n*At your 50x $24 EPS $1,200  price target,* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *returns 11.2% pa from Thursday\u2019s $705.67 close. I happen to think shares in* [*$BRK*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BRK&amp;src=cashtag_click)*, my largest holding, are likely to compound at roughly that rate, assuming a 10% ROE and a terminal price at 1.3x book value, up from \\~1.2x today.*"

   "Selftext": "Triad Pro Innovators ($TPII) has developed proprietary battery technology for use in multiple industries. Their battery is green, eco, and can pair with solar and never need to be plugged in. It has the potential to replace lithium batteries. They have proved their concept within the EV industry with golf carts and are set to announce further applications within the EV market, next with light trucks. Their potential with off-grid batteries and other energy storage is huge!\n\n$TPII has a ridiculously small $7 million market cap and is currently at $0.11 per share. I absolutely expect them to run to $1.00+ in January and $5.00+ easily in 2021. Other similar companies with lesser technologies and companies that own no patents have blown up in price recently. $TPII owns patents and has full control of their tech. They are barely known and once word fully gets out and people see the potential, their price will explode.\n\nI have spoken with Murray Goldenberg, President of Triad Pro Innovators. His number is available if you look for it but I can't post it here. He is aware of the recent uptick in investor interest in his company. Here is his update:\n\n \u2022 They currently have three EV products developed that use their prorpietary e-cell technology. The SPREE golf cart is just one of them and he wouldn't share what the other two are because it hasn't been made public. It is safe to assume one of them is small trucks. They have other applications for their technology developed and in development also. Updates are pending.\n\n \u2022 They are currently selling the golf cart and sales have increased recently. However they have their sights on bigger markets. The golf cart proved their concept and validated their technology. \n\n \u2022 They are in contact with several different firms to help with the funding. COVID has caused some delays but something should be sorted out very soon. They have no toxic funding currently and will not take any on.\n\n \u2022 They do plan on addressing the public soon, likely early in 2021. They started their Twitter account in December and have hinted a bit at things to come. Expect press releases in January.\n\n \u2022 He believes the technology they have created is so great that they intend to take their time and do everything correctly.\n\n \u2022 He invited me to their Arizona facility for a tour and demonstration of their technology, but I declined as that is nowhere near where I live\n\nIn short, $TPII absolutely has something. They need to finish the coordination of funding and develop a sound go-to-market strategy. This will happen and is already in the works.\u00a0$TPII\u00a0will soar when they make an announcement. He has spoken with counsel about doing that right. Murray came off as a genuine guy who knows they have something special. This is a real company with real, revolutionary technology. Their $7 million market cap is a function of them keeping silent while they perfect their tech. They're ready to start moving now."
