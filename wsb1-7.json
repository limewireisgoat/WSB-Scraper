   "Selftext": " \n\nSo about a month or so ago I bought 25 132$ call expiring 1/8/21 on $TIF. They were super cheap at the time (125$ total) and I honestly didn't really understand what I was doing. They were planning on releasing their earnings report late December/ early January. I thought that with the holidays and the general uncertainty of the world. People might be buying jewelry, but the real reason I bought it was because it was cheap and i'm dumb.\n\nWell, now January 8th is tomorrow and the current stock is not showing up on Finviz, yahoo finance or Robinhood. I can see on Google Finance that the AH for TIF is 132.40 which would net me a decent profit, but I can't find the stock through my broker (Robinhood, yea RH. boo... w/e).\n\nI've been looking through the news and discovered that TIF was bought out by LVMH recently for 16 billion, but I'm not sure where that leaves me. Will my options even show up tomorrow? or will it expire worthless. Is the recent buyout the reason why I can't see the shares anymore? Also why was $TIF not really moving at all for the past 3 months.\n\nSuper newbie here, any help is appreciated"

   "Selftext": "Alright boys - welcome to a new addition to the commodity club. We continue our narrative today with Nickel. $.05c about to make you so hard. \n\nQuick disclaimer - today's post will focus on $VALE. So much news to share about why this is about to go to $25-27 by March. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Earnings** \\- [Link](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aqh0bpkatZYkciY7YA4lH8hq3BQ?e=GA4hvF)\n\nEarnings for Q3 were very solid. If you reference the above link, I've shared details into VALE's Q3 earnings. There's a few key takeaways: \n\n* Reference the Avg Prices tab and see what VALE got in Q3 for each commodity. For Q4, there's a few big winners we should expect: \n   * Iron Ore - up 30% in Q4. This is VALE's largest commodity and likely priced into earnings. It is 80% of their revenue. \n   * Met Coal - also up 30% in Q4. This is another huge line item for VALE and was a loss in Q4. At current prices, this will be an easy winner, but only 1% of their revenue. \n   * Copper - up about 20% in Q4. This is 5% of their revenue and drive about $500m in profits in Q4. \n   * Nickel - up about 15% in Q4. This is about 10% of their revenue. \n* VALE made $2.9b in Q3. That's about $.59/share. They have a 3.9% dividend to go along with this. \n* Production was up over Q1 and Q2, but depressed since 2019. Some of this has been a result of declining ore quality and Covid. There was also a landslide that caused some production loss. \n\n**High-Level Research**: \n\nOkay - so core commodity prices are increasing. We also know that VALE sends about 60% of their product to China. So how does this translate? Here's where I explain why Q4 will be amazing, and how Nickel will be the catalyst for a massive earnings beat. \n\n* Iron Ore is super expensive, and we are seeing massive shipments being sent to China. China is so short on steel that they are buying scrap for the first time ever from Japan. Here's a series of articles/tweets to read: \n   * [Post 1](https://twitter.com/YuanTalks/status/1346356073309978624?s=19) \\- Iron Ore hitting record high prices, but shipments falling\n   * [Post 2](https://www.mysteel.net/article/5020695-0501/WEEKLY--Aust--Brazilian-iron-ore-shipment-over-Dec-28-Jan-3.html) \\- looking at shipping details, we see that VALE's shipments actually increased while iron from Australia fell. VALE shipped 6.5m tons of iron in the last week of the year - that's about $1b in revs in a week. \n   * [Post 3](https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-shipments-from-brazil-and-australia-set-record-high/) \\- even though shipments fell in the last week of December, shipments are at all time highs. VALE is literally sending mountains of iron to China at record prices. Yay! \n      * Also note that the Baltic Dry Index is nearing highs too. Shipping rates are expensive and will hurt margins slightly. \n\n**Projections**: \n\nOkay - so Iron is going to be a huge winner in Q4. Right now, here's the earnings projections for VALE: \n\n* Low - $.5/share (about $2.5b in profit) \n* Medium - $.8/share (about $4b in profit) \n* High - $1/share (about $5b in profit) \n\nAt Q3 output levels and current prices, we should expect to be near the high estimate of $1/share. Revs are expected at $12-13b, but should be much higher given current shipping details we've seen from VALE to China. At the worst, we have a Rev and Earnings beat. \n\nSo why Nickel? \n\n**Thesis**: \n\nIf you reference the Q3 Earnings Call - Nickel was the clear callout for VALE's earnings beat last quarter. You'll regularly see Nickel prices and sales being a major driver for increased earnings. \n\nHere's Nickel's [chart](https://tvc-invdn-com.akamaized.net/data/tvc_b0922c4db148b2c166ae2ff909d8183a.png): \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Nickel Futures](https://preview.redd.it/y36ns5ublx961.png?width=1677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d09c9901ac2abdb4914ae42fd17f097c4e069d2)\n\nNickel just broke out and is entering a massive bull market. Currently Nickel is trading at $18,000/ton, which is much higher than VALE's realized price of $15,000/ton in Q3. What's interesting is that Nickel is rising despite [rising stock piles](http://www.kitcometals.com/charts/lmewarehouse.html) in warehouses. \n\nHere's where we get a bit speculative - reference VALE's Nickel production here: [Link](http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/information-market/quarterly-results/QuarterlyResultsDocs/PREREPORT3T20_i_vf.pdf)\n\nMining outputs are variable quarter to quarter due to weather, ore grades, demand, prices, etc - sometimes when bull markets or demand increases, miners turn on production that was previously on hold. We see that in Q3, VALE saw soaring demand for Nickel as it relates to sales, and this would be an indicator for a higher demand for Nickel. However, nickel output is actually down from 2019, when prices were at similar prices to today. \n\nWith nickel prices breaking out and appearing to be headed much higher, VALE might have offline nickel production that they'll turn back on to take advantage of higher demand and prices. Additionally, nickel prices are looking like they might go significantly higher into Q4, and have a much higher price target than say iron or coal. We've also seen VALE buy miners in Indonesia for additional Nickel production, which is aligned with this ongoing Nickel breakout. \n\n**Prediction**: \n\nVALE's nickel output will return to 2019 levels and take advantage of the current pricing. We could see an additional 20m tons produced, and a massive profit line item on Q4. Additionally, if VALE can lock in these prices for Q4 and continue to increase production and see rising prices, Nickel could become 15-20% of VALE's business and bring in over $1b in profit a quarter. \n\nBased on an expected earnings/rev beat and future outlook for VALE, I'm expecting the share price to jump to $25-27 in March based on current P/E and other metrics for the stock. \n\n**Positions**: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0r4768skox961.png?width=718&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc3185bea658f163e58e1a38f8c66f6e1214d8b8"

Demand for the metal is gradually returning as manufacturers are springing to action. Notably, increased demand has led to higher steel prices. Per S&amp;P Global Platts, the benchmark price for hot-rolled steel hit a two-year high of $900 per ton in December 2020, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal article.\n\nMoreover, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported that in the week ending Jan 2, production increased 3.1% from the week ending Dec 26, 2020. Capacity utilization also improved to 80.1% from the previous week\u2019s capacity utilization of 72.3%. Although weekly productions were down on a year-over-year basis, the uptick in production from the prior holiday-induced week bodes well.\n\nReflective of the uptick in demand for steel, manufacturing activity has also been expanding in the United States. Per the latest report from the Institute for Supply Management, the purchasing manager\u2019s index for December was 60.7% compared to 57.5% in November, marking the eighth consecutive month of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Steel Association (\u201cworldsteel\u201d) also forecast in a report that global demand for steel will rise 4.1% in 2021 following an estimated slump of 2.4% in 2020. Moreover, worldsteel predicted that demand for steel in the United States should increase 6.6% in 2021 following an estimated drop of 15.8% in 2020.\n\nSeparately, global production of light vehicles is expected to rebound in 2021. This rebound will be important because the automotive industry is a major contributor to demand for steel. Notably, IHS Markit estimated global light vehicle production to rebound 14% to 84.3 million units in 2021, following an estimated dip of 17% in 2020, as quoted in a Business Wire article. The article further mentioned that in North America, IHS Markit forecast a production increase of 29% on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of 2021 following a cautious view of the first quarter.\n\n4 Steel Stocks to Buy Now\n\nThe outlook for the demand for steel is gradually improving. Steel prices have witnessed an uptick and reflective of the rising demand, manufacturing activity has also continued to expand. Meanwhile, production of light vehicles is also expected to rebound in 2021, a development that bodes well for the steel industry. This makes it a good time to invest in steel stocks that stand to benefit from this improved outlook. We have selected four such stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nArcelorMittal MT, along with its subsidiaries, owns and operates steel manufacturing and mining facilities in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa.

Well, look no further than QQQJ, an ETF which tracks the NASDAQ Next Gen 100 Index (the next 100 NASDAQ companies after the ones in QQQ). \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAs expectations for an economic recovery increase due to the incoming Biden administration, we should see continued growth in the stocks that comprise QQQJ, more so than the large-caps that comprise QQQ. This evidence can be seen by backtesting data provided on the NASDAQ website, which compares the performance of QQQJ against other mid-cap fund performance.\n\n[Backtested 1-year returns](https://preview.redd.it/6m82eh2lnw961.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c7851affb4a37b06d998d79be2c22780a1e58a2)\n\n[Backtested 10-year returns ](https://preview.redd.it/y06ylljinw961.png?width=933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c58927490a95207b50682b37792b98c34088862)\n\nSome of its more well-known holdings include recently beat-down companies such as:\n\n* ROKU (down 5% from December highs)\n* TTD (down 20% from December highs)\n* BYND (down 18% from December highs)\n* DKNG (down 10% from December highs)\n\nDespite this beatdown of its more famous holdings, it's still almost back to pre-December crash highs. More importantly, the premiums on its calls are still lower compared to other similarly priced ETFs.\n\nThe incoming volatility from the swearing in of a new president should also cause\n\nBut won't growth be limited because companies will move into QQQ as soon as they grow? Not necessarily - in a bull market, all stonks go up, including those in QQQ. If all stonks are going up, then everyone wins, but QQQJ wins more.\n\n# More confirmation bias:\n\nBelow is some historic data showing what happens when we have a Democratic president and a split or Republican-led Congress. Combine this with the Roaring Twenties, vaccine hopes, stimulus hopes, economic recovery hopes, and super hot growth potential in healthcare, tech, IT etc, and QQQJ i \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwy5xioxkw961.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a9f4fa13509d8e06e9881b24e9515e7a14c1b17\n\n# Charts\n\nI've done some rudimentary crayon analysis on Tradingview, and as you all can see, we should see QQQJ at 35 sometime around March. This is based on the most bearish analysis I could find based on its current trend and macroeconomic conditions. As you can see, it's shown relatively stable growth thus far (aside from the crash in December).\n\n[Rudimentary Bearish Crayon Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/cgpw2lo6kw961.png?width=1060&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a97dcfa2c8937b07dd5f9fcd903e28a568180e1d)\n\nAlternatively, we could see hyper growth as the stocks in the Next Gen 100 Index rally based on an optimistic outlook from the potential redo of the Roaring Twenties, vaccine hopes, stimulus hopes, economic recovery hopes, and super hot growth potential in healthcare, tech, IT etc. Below is my best bull-case TA drawing:\n\n[Advanced Bull Crayon Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/g6oe3niaow961.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d867780073995d921ef7170fec0e9ae7a1371ee0)\n\n# HERE'S THE KEY POINT\n\nSome of QQQJ's holdings recently suffered major beatdowns and are poised for recovery.\n\nPremiums are higher than they were two weeks ago but still undervalued compared to similarly priced ETFs. June 35cs are going for $1.10 right now. \n\nBased on my ~~astrology~~ TA predictions, these should be ITM by March/April, at which time you can either sell the calls or just exercise them and sell the shares.\n\nBuzzwords:\n\nROARING TWENTIES VACCINE STIMULUS HYPE HEALTHCARE TECH IT RECOVERY STOCKS MOON ROCKET \n\n# Positions\n\n100x June 35c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80"

Now that that disclaimer is done\n\nMan blackberry, who the hell thought I\u2019d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you\u2019re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.\n\nIt is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing. Let\u2019s begin:\n\nBB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. \n\nTechnically, this thing is a fucking beauty. MACD flip, Stoch RSI cross, volume died on the sells and the thing is pushing up just the market died twice while it had solid momentum. This is going to move soon, but let's go away from crayons and into the magical land of make believe, news events, conferences, and fundamentals. It's not just two letters, it's a business. https://www.tradingview.com/x/uI3Cl51F/ \n\n**Recent Earnings**\n\nFiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast| % Surprise\n---|---|----|----|----\nNov 2020| 12/17/2020| 0.1 | -0.04| 100\nAug 2020| 09/24/2020| 0.1| -0.02| 600\nMay 2020| 06/24/2020| 0| -0.04| 100\nFeb 2020| 03/31/2020| 0.06| 0.01| 500\n\n\n\nSurprises along the board.\n\n* Revenues last quarter, $224 MM.\n* Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM.\n* Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. \n* Mkt cap, $4 B. \nTotal company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.\n\n\n\nSaw this cute image of CRWD PLTR and SNOW, all with similar or lower Revs but SNOW is half but worth 20x BB, CRWD has less revs but is operating at 11.75x, PLTR (WSB fav) has 50M more projected annual revs and is worth 11x. Alright who cares about revenue, that's only today. If only it accounted for the big event happening in the next 9 days (see news events below).\n\n**NEWS EVENTS**\n\n*FB settlement*\n\nI\u2019m not going to go into deep detail here as it is quite intricate and all I know is that BB won a suit against fuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and something else. $FB has till January 15th, 2020 to settle, see here: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.331602/gov.uscourts.cand.331602.144.0.pdf \n\nThis FB settlement is not included in earnings expectations, meaning THAT SHIT GOES UP or will be in analyst projections.\n\n*BlackBerry IVY - Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform*\n\nThe big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: \u201cBlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.\u201d\n\nWhat does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers?)\n\n**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**\n\nBlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:\n\nFuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences\nDrive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models\nReduce Costs by moving processing to the edge &amp; reducing raw data transmission\nImprove Operations with enhanced data visibility and access\nExpand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community\n\n\nWanna watch a video? [bideo here](https://youtu.be/fwDnUNENSoY) \n\nWant a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info? https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws Read this and watch their conferences coming up.\n\n**Partnerships with big companies**\n\nBlackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and some other company that I forgot. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY you dumbasses.\n\nPatents\nBB started offloading old patents but have one that will be important as of recent, with the sexiest one being this: https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10880812 \n\nVery pretty stuff, big sex.\n\n\n**Business Implications**\n\nBB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?\n\nBubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn\u2019t have competition? Bitch they cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock (which since MS just upgraded their price, I bet they offer at least $5B in stock in the coming days).\n\n**CONFERENCES**  \n\nBB is speaking at the following conferences:\n\nCiti\u2019s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference - Thursday January 7th, 2021 at 1 PM with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) \n\nJP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum\nTuesday January 12th, 2021 at 5:45 PM ET \nwith the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) \n\nNeedham\u2019s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference \nFriday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15 pm ET \nWith Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect &amp; Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect \n\nThis was just announced and you bet your ass this will pump this stock up.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. This shit trades at $6.70 and is so close to going up if the market just doesn\u2019t crash in the interim. They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile applications, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren\u2019t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. \n\nI think this goes to lower PT of $10 by May, more likely $15. uThInKitWiLLdOUbleINmKTcAp???? Yes you fucking idiot, this is trading at 4X sales only, will be profitable this year, and has so much shit coming up. This is UNDER 4B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just buy the stock and sit on it. Want options? Buy them too. Have fun guys, I hope you all make money.\n\nMy positions:\n\n29 contracts Feb $7C, bought as recently as yesterday.\n1300 Shares, price avg of $7.001. I could have actively traded this prior to ER but decided to long term hold cause I am not a daytrader, and I fully believe in this hypothesis. I wouldn\u2019t be typing this shit if not. Enjoy, go make money"

   "Selftext": "Yeah that\u2019s fucking right ladies and gents, ahem retards and autists.\n\nThe play was JMIA, this company is severely undervalued and isn\u2019t based out of the US so the Biden admin with a Democratic Congress essentially isn\u2019t a threat to margins and profits.\n\nWorth noting now leaps are great as well and I recommend you get in before it\u2019s too late.\n\nAnyways their 2nd capital raise was necessary to become the conglomerate they want to become and I was bullish but after that recent one I became extremely bullish.\n\nSo what was the play? Loaded 150 JMIA Jan. 15 $40\u2019s a minute before market close. We\u2019ll see who wins this one.. had to roll over the 500% $GS $280 calls after yesterday and today.\n\nALSO my FREE ADVICE to you so you can see the same return I did today on $GS. I recommend getting some $300 Jan. 8 calls at open.. $289 and it explodes to $301/$302 fast.\n\nAnd always remember \ud83d\udc8e \u270b\ud83c\udffc\u2018s and \ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b\u2019s."
