   "Selftext": "# Twitter Puts are the logical hedge at the moment\n\n# \n\nLet me explain why:  \n\n\n**1. Twitter has just provoked the eyes of Congress in an unspeakably stupid way**  \nTwitter has for years attempted to fend off Congress by claiming that they're fundamentally neutral, and their Terms of Service don't have real ramifications to speech. By suspending hundreds of prominent conservatives, including POTUS, they've now declared a partisan war which, I can guarantee you, House Democrats are going to be asking \"why didn't you do this before?\". I think the Republican talking points are going to be obvious, but if there was ever a reason to repeal Section 230, this is it.  \n\n\n**2. Twitter's fundamentals suck, and everyone knows it**  \nThe straight fundamentals of Twitter are terrible. They've got a stagnated user base, and by kicking off Trump, they've provoked an exodus which will almost definitely show up in their Feb 9th earnings. At the moment, puts are cheap, as they've been on a bit of a tear upwards. . . but I don't see this continuing. They could lose a lot of revenue from their recent actions, but I don't see anyone hopping ***onto Twitter because they did what they did. This is a net-loss action.***   \n\n\n**3. Puts are cheap**   \n\n\nIf there was ever a good reason to go against Twitter, it's that puts are super cheap at the moment. No one could have foreseen that the Trump rally would go this way. I work at one of the social media companies (not Twitter), and trust me, it caught everyone off-guard. This decision has fundamentally reshaped the investment thesis around social media; non-US dominated versus US dominated / regulatory and anti-trust risk, etc etc etc. Puts are cheap as fuck. I recently paid for some puts (5 contracts of TWTR $48.50 Put 1/15 +  10 contracts of TWTR $40.00 Put 2/26), and it's discounted for sure.  \n\n\n**4. In summary:**  \nYa'll are smart enough to see that this recent action is bullshit. I'm willing to say that this is actually the beginning of the end for Twitter. $FB will last longer because of Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. Reddit has a decent trajectory, but monetization is a bit of an issue. Pinterest is actually the biggest dark-horse of the bunch, though I'm personally bullish on Indian stocks atm.   \n\n\nGood luck autists!"

   "Selftext": "Here me out. \n\nXiaomi Ticker $XIACF is probably one of the most undervalued companies at the moment and here is why:\n\nDespite its weak branding in the Western hemisphere, Xiaomi is one of the largest tech companies in the world. Standing at rank four, Xiaomi competes against electronic manufacturing giants such as\u00a0Apple, Google, and Microsoft.\n\nAffordable pricing\n\nXiaomi offers smartphones and other electronic devices at extremely competitive prices. This is extremely important for two reasons. First off, Xiaomi\u2019s budget-friendly pricing allows them to compete for the more budget-friendly consumers in developed regions. Secondly, it allows them to enter new, previously-untapped markets in which smartphones were previously too expensive. For example,\u00a0Xiaomi is able to sell millions of devices in the Asian market, especially in China and\u00a0India, which would be impossible as a luxury brand such as Apple or Samsung.\n\nSubstantial profit margins\n\nMost amazing of all, Xiaomi is able to offer quality products at affordable prices, and still make plenty of profit for themselves. Quite consistently,\u00a0Xiaomi has posted profits\u00a0amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. Xiaomi can thank low manufacturing costs for their high-profit margins. These low manufacturing costs are likely due to\u00a0the low cost of labor in China, as well as the significant economy of scale which arises when manufacturing so many devices.\n\nTLDR; undervalued stock with high potential waiting to blow up.\n\nLet's take this fucker to the moon: \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80"
